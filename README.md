At the core of Dagger.jl is a scheduler heavily inspired by [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/). It can run computations represented as [directed-acyclic-graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAGs) efficiently on many Julia worker processes and threads, as well as GPUs via [DaggerGPU.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/DaggerGPU.jl).


## Installation

You can install Dagger by typing

```julia
julia> ] add Dagger
```

## Usage

Once installed, the `Dagger` package can by used like so

```julia
using Distributed; addprocs() # get us some workers
using Dagger

# do some stuff in parallel!
a = Dagger.@spawn 1+3
b = Dagger.@spawn rand(a, 4)
c = Dagger.@spawn sum(b)+a
fetch(c) # some number!
```
