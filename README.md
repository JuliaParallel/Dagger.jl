At the core of Dagger.jl is a scheduler heavily inspired by [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/). It can run computations represented as [directed-acyclic-graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAGs) efficiently on many Julia worker processes and threads, as well as GPUs via [DaggerGPU.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/DaggerGPU.jl).

*The **DTable** has been moved out of this repository. You can now find it [here](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/DTables.jl).*

## Installation

Dagger.jl can be installed using the Julia package manager. Enter the Pkg REPL
mode by typing "]" in the Julia REPL and then run:

```julia
pkg> add Dagger
```

Or, equivalently, install Dagger via the Pkg API:

```julia
julia> import Pkg; Pkg.add("Dagger")
```

## Usage

Once installed, the `Dagger` package can be loaded with `using Dagger`, or if
you want to use Dagger for distributed computing, it can be loaded as:

```julia
using Distributed; addprocs() # Add one Julia worker per CPU core
using Dagger
```

You can run the following example to see how Dagger exposes easy parallelism:

```julia
# This runs first:
a = Dagger.@spawn rand(100, 100)

# These run in parallel:
b = Dagger.@spawn sum(a)
c = Dagger.@spawn prod(a)

# Finally, this runs:
wait(Dagger.@spawn println("b: ", b, ", c: ", c))
```

## Use Cases

Dagger can support a variety of use cases that benefit from easy, automatic
parallelism, such as:

- [Parallelizing Nested Loops](https://juliaparallel.org/Dagger.jl/dev/use-cases/parallel-nested-loops/#Use-Case:-Parallel-Nested-Loops)

This isn't an exhaustive list of the use cases that Dagger supports. There are
more examples in the docs, and more use cases examples are welcome (just file
an issue or PR).
