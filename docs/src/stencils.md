# Stencil Operations

The `@stencil` macro in Dagger.jl provides a convenient way to perform stencil computations on `DArray`s. It operates within a `Dagger.spawn_datadeps()` block and allows you to define operations that apply to each element of a `DArray`, potentially accessing values from each element's neighbors.

## Basic Usage

The fundamental structure of a `@stencil` block involves iterating over an implicit index, named `idx` in the following example , which represents the coordinates of an element in the processed `DArray`s.

```julia
using Dagger
import Dagger: @stencil, Wrap, Pad

# Initialize a DArray
A = zeros(Blocks(2, 2), Int, 4, 4)

Dagger.spawn_datadeps() do
    @stencil begin
        A[idx] = 1 # Assign 1 to every element of A
    end
end

@assert all(collect(A) .== 1)
```

In this example, `A[idx] = 1` is executed for each chunk of `A`. The `idx` variable corresponds to the indices within each chunk.

## Neighborhood Access with `@neighbors`

The true power of stencils comes from accessing neighboring elements. The `@neighbors` macro facilitates this.

`@neighbors(array[idx], distance, boundary_condition)`

- `array[idx]`: The array and current index from which to find neighbors.
- `distance`: An integer specifying the extent of the neighborhood (e.g., `1` for a 3x3 neighborhood in 2D).
- `boundary_condition`: Defines how to handle accesses beyond the array boundaries. Available conditions are:
    - `Wrap()`: Wraps around to the other side of the array.
    - `Pad(value)`: Pads with a specified `value`.

### Example: Averaging Neighbors with `Wrap`

```julia
import Dagger: Wrap

# Initialize a DArray
A = ones(Blocks(1, 1), Int, 3, 3)
A[2,2] = 10 # Central element has a different value
B = zeros(Blocks(1, 1), Float64, 3, 3)

Dagger.spawn_datadeps() do
    @stencil begin
        # Calculate the average of the 3x3 neighborhood (including the center)
        B[idx] = sum(@neighbors(A[idx], 1, Wrap())) / 9.0
    end
end

# Manually calculate expected B for verification
expected_B = zeros(Float64, 3, 3)
A_collected = collect(A)
for r in 1:3, c in 1:3
    local_sum = 0.0
    for dr in -1:1, dc in -1:1
        nr, nc = mod1(r+dr, 3), mod1(c+dc, 3)
        local_sum += A_collected[nr, nc]
    end
    expected_B[r,c] = local_sum / 9.0
end

@assert collect(B) â‰ˆ expected_B
```

### Example: Convolution with `Pad`

```julia
import Pad

# Initialize a DArray
A = ones(Blocks(2, 2), Int, 4, 4)
B = zeros(Blocks(2, 2), Int, 4, 4)

Dagger.spawn_datadeps() do
    @stencil begin
        B[idx] = sum(@neighbors(A[idx], 1, Pad(0))) # Pad with 0
    end
end

# Expected result for a 3x3 sum filter with zero padding
expected_B_padded = [
    4 6 6 4;
    6 9 9 6;
    6 9 9 6;
    4 6 6 4
]
@assert collect(B) == expected_B_padded
```

## Sequential Semantics

Expressions within a `@stencil` block are executed sequentially in terms of their effect on the data. This means that the result of one statement is visible to the subsequent statements, as if they were applied "all at once" across all indices before the next statement begins.

```julia
A = zeros(Blocks(2, 2), Int, 4, 4)
B = zeros(Blocks(2, 2), Int, 4, 4)

Dagger.spawn_datadeps() do
    @stencil begin
        A[idx] = 1  # First, A is initialized
        B[idx] = A[idx] * 2       # Then, B is computed using the new values of A
    end
end

expected_A = [1 for r in 1:4, c in 1:4]
expected_B_seq = expected_A .* 2

@assert collect(A) == expected_A
@assert collect(B) == expected_B_seq
```

## Operations on Multiple `DArray`s

You can read from and write to multiple `DArray`s within a single `@stencil` block, provided they have compatible chunk structures.

```julia
A = ones(Blocks(1, 1), Int, 2, 2)
B = DArray(fill(3, 2, 2), Blocks(1, 1))
C = zeros(Blocks(1, 1), Int, 2, 2)

Dagger.spawn_datadeps() do
    @stencil begin
        C[idx] = A[idx] + B[idx]
    end
end
@assert all(collect(C) .== 4)
```

## Example: Game of Life

The following demonstrates a more complex example: Conway's Game of Life.

```julia
# Ensure Plots and other necessary packages are available for the example
using Plots

N = 27 # Size of one dimension of a tile
nt = 3 # Number of tiles in each dimension (results in nt x nt grid of tiles)
niters = 10 # Number of iterations for the animation

tiles = zeros(Blocks(N, N), Bool, N*nt, N*nt)
outputs = zeros(Blocks(N, N), Bool, N*nt, N*nt)

# Create a fun initial state (e.g., a glider and some random noise)
tiles[13, 14] = true
tiles[14, 14] = true
tiles[15, 14] = true
tiles[15, 15] = true
tiles[14, 16] = true
# Add some random noise in one of the tiles
@view(tiles[(2N+1):3N, (2N+1):3N]) .= rand(Bool, N, N)



anim = @animate for _ in 1:niters
    Dagger.spawn_datadeps() do
        @stencil begin
            outputs[idx] = begin
                nhood = @neighbors(tiles[idx], 1, Wrap())
                neighs = sum(nhood) - tiles[idx] # Sum neighborhood, but subtract own value
                if tiles[idx] && neighs < 2
                    0 # Dies of underpopulation
                elseif tiles[idx] && neighs > 3
                    0 # Dies of overpopulation
                elseif !tiles[idx] && neighs == 3
                    1 # Becomes alive by reproduction
                else
                    tiles[idx] # Keeps its prior value
                end
            end
            tiles[idx] = outputs[idx] # Update tiles for the next iteration
        end
    end
    heatmap(Int.(collect(outputs))) # Generate a heatmap visualization
end
path = mp4(anim; fps=5, show_msg=true).filename # Create an animation of the heatmaps over time
```
